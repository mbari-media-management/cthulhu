/**
 * A more stable source of time events for a media player.
 * <p>
 * The native media player sends somewhat irregular time changes which if strictly adhered to will provide a less than
 * optimal user experience, this component attempts to provide a more stable timer aiming to give smooth
 * updates for timer displays.
 * <p>
 * The accuracy and other characteristics of the time events from the native media player depend on the decoder that is
 * being used to play the media, therefore it is not trivial to come up with a perfect one-size-fits-all implementation
 * for this timer. At least the approximation implemented here as better than the default.
